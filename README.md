## Data Availability

The raw multi-party transcripts used in this project are protected and cannot be 
publicly released. Therefore, this repository contains:

- code for preprocessing, stance decomposition, and embedding generation
- meta-prompts used for structured JSON output
- visualization for full & sub positions trajectories

To reproduce the analysis, users should provide their own transcript data with a 
similar structure.
